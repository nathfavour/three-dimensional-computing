# Contributing to Three-Dimensional Computing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this revolutionary project! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the Three-Dimensional Computing project.

## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to the project:

1. **Hardware Design**: Contribute to the development of trinary logic circuits and memory components
2. **Software Development**: Improve the trinary programming language, compiler, or runtime
3. **Algorithm Design**: Develop algorithms that leverage three-dimensional computing advantages
4. **Documentation**: Help improve project documentation, tutorials, or examples
5. **Research**: Conduct theoretical or experimental research on three-dimensional computing concepts
6. **Testing**: Test implementations and provide feedback

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment (see below)
4. Create a new branch for your contribution
5. Make your changes
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Environment Setup

### Hardware Simulation

To work with the hardware simulation components:

1. Install Python 3.8 or newer
2. Install required packages: `pip install numpy scipy matplotlib`
3. Run the simulation scripts in the `/simulations` directory

### Software Development

To work on the trinary programming language and compiler:

1. Install the Tri-Lang toolchain (see `/software/toolchain/README.md`)
2. Set up your IDE with the Tri-Lang syntax highlighting (optional)
3. Explore the examples in the `/examples` directory

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards
2. Add appropriate tests for your changes
3. Update documentation as necessary
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes
5. Address any feedback from code reviewers

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Write comprehensive comments and documentation
- Follow the existing code structure and style

### Trinary-Specific Guidelines

- When implementing trinary logic, always consider all three states (-1, 0, 1)
- Include truth tables for new trinary operations
- Compare performance with binary equivalents where applicable

## Research Contributions

For research contributions:

1. Submit a research proposal to the project leads
2. Follow established experimental methodologies
3. Document your research clearly, including methods and results
4. Provide references to relevant existing research

## Questions and Communication

- For general questions, use the Discussions section on GitHub
- For specific issues, create an Issue with detailed information
- For security concerns, contact the maintainers directly
